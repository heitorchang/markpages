# MarkPages

A simple CRUD app that saves "pages" as Markdown (*.md) files in the "pages/" directory.

## Installation

As this project was created only for personal use, there is no security built in.

The PHP process' user must have write access to this directory (to create the `markpages.zip` file for download) and the `pages/` directory (to create `*.md` files).
